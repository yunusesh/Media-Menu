- Uses **Caffeine** to cache lookups on the backend for faster fetches from the frontend  
- Connects to the **Spotify API** to get user listening data  
- Sends this information to the frontend for display  
> **Flow:** MusicBrainz API → Backend → Frontend  

### Frontend
- Uses **React Router** for dynamic page rendering  
- Caches recently visited pages locally with **React Query**
